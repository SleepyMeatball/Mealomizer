# Hi
This one is a learning project for me. A simple random meal selector to decide what to eat this evening. When you ask nicely ("Mealomizer random \<tags-if-any\>") it gives you an url to a random meal matching the tags provided. And now you're free from the inevitible crushing reality of having to choose (or make someone choose) what to eat at dinner. And I added a simple file reading and writing system so you can include your own lists. Maybe I'll work on an actual database in the future but this project is far from that kind of effort and seriousness. Have fun!

### Commands (WORK IN PROGRESS)
I tried to make it work similar to popular console applications like git. You first put in the name of the program in the console (no shit amirite) then specify the command, subcommand and flags where appropriate.

* start (this does nothing I've added for the case I implement an actual gui)
* random \<tags\> : you know what this is
